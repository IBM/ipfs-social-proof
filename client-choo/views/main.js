          <p>
            Your project also comes with a few directories. These names have
            special meanings for the build tool, so it's good to know what they
            do.
          </p>

            So far we've provided you with one base view, <a
            href="/oh-no">one fallback view</a>, and one store. This serves
            as an example. A place to start from. It's your project now, so
            go ahead and delete them once you know how they work.
